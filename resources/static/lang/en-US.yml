    <b>Lyrics: James Date</b><br/><br/>
    You are<br/>
    The greatest girl<br/>
    Even far apart<br/>
    It must be reached you<br/>
    So that I can<br/>
    Keep my promise<br/>
    When we hook the pinky<br/>
    Even from here, I'll sing<br/>
    Let's hoist high love<br/>
    In the cloudless blue sky<br/>
